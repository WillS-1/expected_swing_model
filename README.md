# Expected Swing Model
Logistic Regression model intended to predict whether or not a pitch resulted in a swing or not.


This project utilizies several different packages in R as I attempt to create a model using logistic regression with the intention of predicting whether a pitch in baseball resulted in a swing or not. 

In this project you will find one file called Expected_Swing_EntireProject.R which has the entire project all organized in one file. Additionally, there are 5 other files that have split up the project into sections. 

The following can be found in each of the 5 separate files. 

1. Data Retrevial and Cleaning
2. Functions
3. Graphs and Heatmaps
4. Tables
5. Models

The packages needed for the project can be found at the top of each R file.

Within this project, data cleaning and manipulation, visual analysis, machine learning and statistical inferences are all showcased. 

Finally, the project description along with my findings are in a PDF file in this repository explaining everything including my conclusion.
